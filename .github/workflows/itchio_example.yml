name: GD-CICD Actions - Godot Build and Publish to itch.io
run-name: ðŸš€ ${{ github.actor }} is publishing to itch.io! ðŸ¦„

# This simple workflow demonstrates how to use the GD-CICD actions to build a Godot project and publish it to Itch.io.

# It uses the `digiur/GDCICD` actions to fetch the Godot engine, build the project, and publish it to Itch.io using Butler.
# A single HTML5 export preset named "web" is expected to be defined in your Godot project.
# Make sure to set your Itch.io API key in the GitHub Secrets as `ITCHIO_API_KEY`.
# and change the `itchio_target` to your Itch.io user and project name.
